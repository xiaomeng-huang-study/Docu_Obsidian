# Limitations of classic Project Management 


## Agile 
- Characteristic 
	- Phase-overlapping 
		- later project phases may already start, although earlier ones have not been finished yet. 
- Requirement 
	- more flexibility and communication 
	- involve doble work 
- Examples 
	- [[Note_A2#Simultaneous Engineering|Simultaneous Engineering]] / concurrent engineering 
	- [[Note_A2#Scrum|Scrum]] 
	- [[Note_A2#Kanban|Kanban]] 

### Simultaneous Engineering

- Characteristic 
	- Divide 1 entire project into small projects. Each small project is shippable after finished. 
- Differences between product owner and scrum master 
	- Product owner 
		- product's vision 
		- backlog 
		- stakeholder communication 
	- Scrum Master 
		- facilitate the Scrum process 
		- coach the team 
		- remove barriers 
- Projects, that are not suitable for SCRUM 
- How project goal and project objectives implemented 

### Kanban 
- Key elements 
	- Board 
	- Cards / Tickets 
	- Columns 
	- Swimlanes 
		- horizontal sections on the Kanban board that categorize tasks or work items based on certain criteria. e.g. important 
	- Work In Progress (WIP) Limits 
		- constraints set on the number of tasks or work items allowed in each column or across the entire board. 
	- Pull-principle 
		- idea of work being pulled through the system based on capacity and demand, rather than being pushed onto the team. 


## Complexity and Uncertainties 
- VUCA (Volatility 不稳定性, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity) 
- BANI (Brittle 易碎的, Anxious 担忧的, Non-linear, Incomprehensible 费解的) 
- Framework for decision 
	- Cynefin
