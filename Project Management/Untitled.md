# Overview
Let me now introduce the concept of Work Breakdown Structure. In our project, we have divided the project into four main segments: "As-Is analysis," "Optimization of energy consumption," "Evaluation of possible renewable energy sources," and "Practical implementation."

The first segment, "As-Is analysis," involves a examination of the current situation. This step helps us gain a clear understanding of the existing energy infrastructure and its performance.

Moving on to the second part, "Optimization of energy consumption," we ==strive== to make the best possible adjustments to the current energy usage. However, we understand that only optimization might not sufficient. Therefore, we are exploring the integration of renewable energy sources to revamp our energy system.

This leads us to the third segment, where we conduct an evaluation of various potential renewable energy sources. We aim to identify the most suitable options that align with our university's energy requirements and environmental sustainability goals.

Finally, we have the crucial stage of "Practical implementation." Here, we put our plans into action, incorporating the insights gathered from the previous phases to transition our energy resources into a more sustainable and efficient system.

Now, let's dive into the first phase, the "As-Is analysis." To begin, we'll start with an ==in-depth analysis== of the university's ==current energy consumption==. By asking ==someone in university==, who is responsible for that, we can gather the data on the types of energy sources and their respective proportions

Next, we'll calculate the ==portions== of energy that can potentially be ==replaced== with renewable sources. It's important to ==note== that a complete transition to renewable energy at present might not be feasible in all areas. Some critical infrastructure, for instance, may still require ==stable== and conventional energy sources to ensure uninterrupted operation.

However, gathering ==statistical data== alone is not sufficient. We'll complement this with on-site assessments at the university. For instance, we'll examine the university's rooftops and assess the availability of solar energy options based on factors such as roof condition and solar exposure.

Moving on to the second phase, the "Optimization of energy consumption," we need to identify opportunities to reduce energy consumption and minimize energy costs ==without disrupting== the university's daily routine. This part will be introduced in detail later in the presentation.

Additionally, we'll take the budget into consideration, which is a critical factor. We'll explore cost-effective contracts with energy suppliers to ensure we get the best value for our energy requirements.

It's essential to note that these considerations will require approval from the university. If the university takes the recommendations mentioned above into account and grants approval, we can proceed with the implementation of these energy optimization measures.

# 3
In our evaluation of energy sources, we== differentiate== between internal and external sources. Internal sources refer to energy produced by THU itself and consumed within its premises. After conducting thorough on-site assessments, we will evaluate the potential energy sources and assess their respective ==capacities==. These evaluations will be translated into easily comparable cost analyses to determine whether it's viable for THU to adopt these renewable energy sources internally.

Alternatively, we may also consider ==relying on== external sources. For instance, if the municipal ==government of Ulm== has already started ==replacing== some traditional energy sources and is encouraging businesses and educational institutions to adopt renewable energy, we can explore the option of sourcing energy externally. By utilizing external renewable energy sources, we can potentially bypass the complexities associated with installing new infrastructure on our campus. We will conduct a comparative cost analysis to assess the feasibility of this approach.

In the practical implementation phase, our first step is to order the necessary materials for installation. For example, if we take solar energy as an example, this would be ordering the solar panels required for the project. To ensure the ==effective installation and functioning== of these solar panels, we will give the task to a installation company.

Achieving 100% self-sufficiency may not be feasible. Therefore, we will conclude contracts with external energy suppliers ensure the remaining portion of our energy needs.

Lastly, it is necessary to conduct a ==assessment of the entire project==. This evaluation will analyze the overall benefits that the project will bring. This evaluation will examine whether the project yields the expected benefits and if it aligns with our sustainability and cost-efficiency goals.

# 1.1
Our first crucial step is to analyze the university building's annual energy consumption. By conducting a examination, we aim to gain ==insights into the specific energy sectors==, such as heat and electricity. This analysis will provide us with a comprehensive understanding of the ==energy usage breakdown==, enabling us to identify potential areas for optimization and renewable energy integration.

Furthermore, we will delve into researching the sources from which the energy is currently provided. Understanding the existing energy providers and their supply chains is essential for evaluating the feasibility of integrating renewable energy sources and optimizing energy consumption.
