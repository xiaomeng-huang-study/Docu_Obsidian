- Capacity 
	- The maximum amount you can produce or accomplish within a regular working schedule, with a fixed amount of resources 
- Troubleshooting, if the capacity is reached 
	- Delay WP within the float 
	- additional resources in project team 
	- Exchange persons responsible for WP 
	- Outsource WP 外购, 外包 
	- Adjust project schedule and accept new critical path with delay 

- Costs 
	- Offer 
		- Cumulated costs of all WP provide a first estimate of the total project costs. 
	- Plan 
		- expected costs in a given time interval 
	- Control 
		- Activities to control the cost performance during the project 
		- Cost Performance Index (CPI) 
			- Relationship between value of work accomplished ("the earned value") and the actual costs incurred to accomplish that work.  
			- (older definition) 
				- BCWP (Budget Costs of Work Performed) = planed costs of completed task/ WP 
				- ACWP (Actual Costs of Work Performed) 
			- narrow definition (only costs)
				- $CPI = \frac{EV}{AC}$ 
					- EV = BCWP : the actual costs spent 
					- AC = ACWP : the planed costs spent 
			- general definition (not only costs) 
				- $CPI = \frac{value, ~benefit ~...}{costs, ~resources, ~...}$ 
				- sometimes value $\neq$ costs 
		- Problem for project analysis only according to CPI 
			- time information missed 
			- e.g. 
				-
