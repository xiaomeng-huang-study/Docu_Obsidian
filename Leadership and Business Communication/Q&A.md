# Situational Leadership Model 
The Situational Leadership Model, developed by Paul Hersey and Ken Blanchard in the late 1960s, is a leadership theory that suggests that effective leaders adjust their leadership style based on the readiness or maturity of their followers. The model focuses on two key elements: leadership style and the maturity of the followers.

1. **Leadership Styles:** The Situational Leadership Model identifies four primary leadership styles:
    
    - **Telling (S1):** In this style, the leader provides clear instructions and closely supervises the task. It is characterized by high directive behavior and low supportive behavior.
        
    - **Selling (S2):** The leader still provides direction but is more open to communication and feedback. This style combines high directive and high supportive behavior.
        
    - **Participating (S3):** The leader delegates decision-making authority to the followers, emphasizing support rather than direction. It is characterized by low directive and high supportive behavior.
        
    - **Delegating (S4):** In this style, the leader provides minimal guidance, allowing the followers to take on more responsibility. It is characterized by low directive and low supportive behavior.
        
2. **Follower Maturity:** The model defines follower maturity in terms of two factors:
    
    - **Task Maturity:** The ability and skills of the followers to perform a specific task.
    - **Psychological Maturity:** The confidence, commitment, and motivation of the followers.
3. **Matching Leadership Style to Follower Maturity:** The central idea of the Situational Leadership Model is to match the leadership style to the maturity of the followers. The model proposes the following guidelines:
    
    - **Low Maturity (Telling - S1):** For followers with low task and psychological maturity, leaders should use a telling style, providing clear instructions and supervision.
        
    - **Moderate Maturity (Selling - S2):** For followers with moderate task and low psychological maturity, a selling style is recommended. The leader should provide both direction and support.
        
    - **Moderate to High Maturity (Participating - S3):** When followers have moderate to high task maturity but may lack confidence or motivation, leaders should use a participating style, emphasizing support and collaboration.
        
    - **High Maturity (Delegating - S4):** For followers with high task and psychological maturity, leaders can adopt a delegating style, providing minimal guidance and allowing followers to take on more responsibility.
