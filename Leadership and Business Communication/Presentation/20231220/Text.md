# Slide 5 
- We need to analyze the current model, the Garbage-Can-Model. 
- There are 4 Elements, that have influence on the decision. 
	- situations -> factors, that affect the decision
	- problems -> issues or challenges, that we are facing 
	- solutions -> ideas or proposals, with that to deal with problems 
	- participants -> people, who are involved or interested in the decision 
- This model explains, how they interact with each other. 
- Here are some Features of this model 
	- The decision is based on random events or opportunities, based on random participation. 
	- There is also restriction, if you want to use it. 

# Slide 6 
- After the analysis, we find 3 shortcomings 
	- First, the decision processes are unstructured and chaotic, because people donâ€™t know their roles and responsibilities 
	- Second, there is a lack of communication between people and departments, which makes the information flow and the plans unclear. 
	- Third, the decisions are not based on data, but on chance, which makes them unreliable.

- With such new structures, we can get better information interaction and decision making and better planning of projects. 

# Slide 12
- And with improved project-planning, the benefits should be reflected in the economy. 
- If we extend the timeline from 10 to 20 projects, we can see that project spending will be returned to an acceptable range, i.e., below the red line.
